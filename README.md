#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


1.	Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software Engineering is the process of creating high quality software systems that power various aspects of modern life. Software Engineering has helped to ease big tasks in various industries by the creation of software applications and systems. 


2.	Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
1. Development of Programming Languages
2. The Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960’s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s 


3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Requirements: Basically, we figure out what everyone needs and what the software should do. We ask a bunch of questions and write down what people expect.
   Design: Now we draw up the blueprints. It’s like creating a roadmap of what the app will look like and how it’ll work, from big picture stuff down to the little details.
   Implementation: Time to get coding! We actually build the thing, writing all the code to bring our design to life.
   Testing: Now we break it. Just kidding! We test everything to make sure it works, fix bugs, and make sure it’s all running smooth.
   Deployment: This is when we let the world see our masterpiece! We release the software out into the wild and make it available to everyone.
   Maintenance: After it’s out there, we keep an eye on things. If anything breaks, or if we need to make updates or add new features, we handle it!


4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The main difference is that Waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before moving on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project.

Waterfall is mainly used when the requirements are fully understood. Whereas, Agile is used in a flexible environment when the project is evolving.

5.	Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes the Code
Quality Assurance Engineer: Designs and Executes Test Plans
Project Manager: Oversees planning, Execution and delivery of software projects

6.	Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Help to make writing, debugging and testing of codes easy. Examples are; VS Code

Version Control Systems: They help to facilitate work among team members. Thus, tracking changes for easy reversibility of changes. Examples are; GitHub

7.	What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines, Technical Debt and Requirement Changing which can be Overcomed by Prioritization of tasks, Effective Communication and Agile Methodologies.


8.	Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing Individual Software Components
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components
System: Testing the entire software
Acceptance: Testing the Software to ensure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1.	Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is simply the process of giving questions or statements to get the best responses from AI Models. It Prevents Vague responses from AI Models. 


2.	Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Translate seon-bae

Improved Prompt: Translate “Seon-bae” in Korean to English

The Improved Prompt will make the Model know which language I am referring to.
